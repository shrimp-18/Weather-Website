                <h2>About the Developer :</h2>
                <p>Hey! I'm Neha , a passionate web/game developer based in Dehradun,India !
                    I'm currently in my final year of high school and i try to code stuff whenever 
                    i get time. I also do hardware sometimes :D. 
                </p>
                <h2>About the Website :</h2>
                <p>This website is made with HTML, CSS, JS and uses API Keys from Open Weather Map 
                    to provide data about the current weather of the location and also the forecast 
                    of the next five days !
                    It also has a button using which the website automatically detects your current location
                    and provides real time weather data !

                </p>
                <br>
                <p> Hope you enjoy using the website </p>
